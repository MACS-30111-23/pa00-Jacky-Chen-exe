# Summary and Reflection
I have had experience with Github and Git in some prior courses, which have intensively based on R. So for this assignment, I first
cloned the repository to my local machine, opened the README file with RStudio, edit as requested, and then pushed the changes to the remote repository. 
I have used Markdown before and mostly with RMarkdown, so I am familiar with the syntax. However, I have never used Markdown with Python before, and I wish
to learn more about applying Python to Markdown in the future, and also using Python for quantitative analysis, which perteins to my major and future career.
